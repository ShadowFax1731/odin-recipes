    <h4>This chicken casserole topped with chili cheese Fritos is cheesy, crunchy, colorful, loaded with flavor, and the ultimate comfort food.</h4>
    <p>Better yet, the prep only dirties up one pot. Serve with salsa, sour cream, and chopped cilantro if you like.</p>

        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>

        <li><p>Add chicken, beans, corn, cream of chicken soup, tomatoes and chiles (with juice), green chiles, cream cheese, and cilantro. Cook until cream cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Spread out 1/3 of the chips on the bottom of a 9x13 inch rectangular casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the chicken mixture. Top chicken mixture with 1/3 of shredded Cheddar cheese.

        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted and is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, cover, and let sit for 30 minutes so it can set before cutting into squares.</p></li>

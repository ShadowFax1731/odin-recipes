    <h3>A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings.</h3>
    <p>These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings.</p>
    <p>They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Baking Powder</li>
        <li>White Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter or Margarine</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>These dumplings start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Baking powder is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><p>A teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings.</p></li>
        <li>A pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender.</li>
        <li>Whole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough.</li>
    </ol>
